            <p align="left" style="padding:10px 10px;line-height:18px;font-size:13px;"><strong>We are the company we keep</strong> | 36Stories is run globally with a small team consising of  ninja designers, code wizards and wicked server engineers from the USA, Asia-Pacific and some parts of Europe. We love agile development, staying nimble, keeping late nights and munching on really good pizza. </p>
            <p align="left" style="padding:10px 10px;line-height:18px;font-size:13px;">We have a philosophy that work should be fun, innovative and that we should do our best to change the world for the better, no matter the size of the impact. Life is too short to be chasing the wrong things and that each of us has a special part to play in making things better for every business, service and partner we work with.</p>
            <p align="left" style="padding:10px 10px;line-height:18px;font-size:13px;">We'd definitely love to hear from you (even if you're not a customer!) .

                	<h2>Mathew Wong - CTO, Co-Founder</h2>
                    <p>Mathew always had an obsession with Legos which were the only toy he's ever played with since his childhood. He is an obsessive builder who enjoys creating things using pure imagination with an ample supply of Lego blocks and refuses to be limited to pre-manufactured toys which makes him an ideal architect or engineer. Since he is clumsy and the thought of him using power tools is out of the question, he opted for a career in software engineering instead (good choice!).</p>
                    <p>Mathew likes walking, meditating, driving well engineered cars, playing tennis and Warhammer 40K. He's eagerly waiting for the new 6th edition rules to come out because in his opinion, the 5th edition favors the Space Marines too much. He has a love-hate relationship with PHP and wonders what the world's software will be like if it were all written in Python.</p>

                    <p>R.Z is a geek at heart who loves the creation and automation of software to make life for himself and others a lot simpler. Brought up around computers, design and the web from an early age, he has a deep passion for creating and designing usable, intuitive interfaces and user experience processes to ensure that things work simply.

					<p>R.Z also plans to build a Tuscany-styled house and a Japanese garden in the near future, which requires minimal effort to upkeep with a series of complex pulleys, motion sensors and automated watering systems. His mind is often is full of thoughts on how to reverse-engineer the concept of time.</p>

                	<h2>Henry Castor -  Design Manager</h2>
                    <p>Henry started off as a CSS/HTML developer but ended up being more interested in the crazy field of web design. He has been a workaholic since his days of working part-time to financially support his education and this experience taught him to be driven and determined in everything that he does and to have an optimistic view of the things that he can achieve in life. As a result, Henry is highly focused, independent, and never gets tired of learning. He is a creative risk taker who is not afraid to take risks, and strives to make his work different from the rest.</p>
                    <p>When he is not designing, Henry often engages in photography, hitting the gym, and other sports activities where he tries hard to be athletic – though he prefers to slouch in his couch, munch on food, and watch movies on rainy afternoons, but who doesn't?</p>

                    <p>Dan Oliver is driven by his strong passion for web design and development. His Multimedia Arts training allowed him to master fundamentals of animation, creativity and web design. Gaining more interest in the field, Dan Oliver studied PHP programming which molded him to become the super awesome web developer that he is today. He is a creative perfectionist and likes to do things in a smart manner – utilizing less time yet not compromising the quality of his work – and gets bored if he doesn't exceed what is expected of him.</p>
                    <p>Dan Oliver's resourcefulness and the ability to learn quickly proves to be a major advantage among others and allows him to excel. It is in his nature to make websites and other creations unique, accessible, simple yet elegant, and applies his own set of rock star standards in development (beat that!).</p>
